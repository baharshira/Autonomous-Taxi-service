# Autonomous Taxi Service Simulation

This project simulates an autonomous taxi service where taxis are assigned to ride requests within a 20x20 km grid. Requests are generated every 20 seconds, and taxis are updated every 10 seconds. The simulation uses a hybrid output model: key events are printed to the console, while errors are logged via a centralized logging system.
